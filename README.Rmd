# Diabetes Risk Prediction

### Model Type: XGBoost Multiclass Classifier 

### Author: Emmanuel Fagbenle

#### What It Does:

This model predicts an individualâ€™s diabetes status. No diabetes (0), prediabetes (1), or diabetes (2) using self-reported health data. It was trained on the 2015 CDC BRFSS dataset and focuses on 8 key features like blood pressure, BMI, and general health.

#### Data Source:

The data comes from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS 2015), a large U.S. health survey. Each row represents a unique adult respondent with 21 health and lifestyle features.

#### Methodology:

We chose XGBoost for its high accuracy, speed, and ability to model nonlinear relationships in multiclass classification tasks. The model was trained on 80% of the data and evaluated on the remaining 20%.

To enhance interpretability, we extracted the top 8 features driving predictions. These included: HighBP, GenHlth, BMI, Age, HighChol, Income, HeartDiseaseorAttack, and PhysHlth.

#### Use Cases

Public Health Agencies: Early identification of high-risk groups to improve outreach and preventive care. Healthcare Providers: Decision support tool for clinicians during routine screenings. Researchers: Feature importance analysis for academic and policy insights.
